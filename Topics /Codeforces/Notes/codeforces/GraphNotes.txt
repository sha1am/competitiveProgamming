My skillset matches the job profile and I to be a
An effective communicator with a proven track record of excelling in the task assigned to me.

I am really interested for working at Dreamspring a proven track record of excelling in the task assigned to me.

I would like to say two interships as an experience as a frontend developer and 


I would be more than excited to join Dreamspring as it matches my current skillset and future goals.

AI enabled drone to capture pictures on vacation spots and users can download those images from anywhere in the world. 

The idea is to capture so vivid and beautiful images so that the user is urged to download and subscribe to online gallary network which would be a free place to download your past clicked images. 




Traffic light optimizer - using AI and machine learing we will develop a software which will decide the time of red and green light on traffic signals while taking live traffic data from google maps optimally so that the total average waiting time can be reduced.
1. What is the problem that you want/wish to solve? - Save time.
2. Who experiences that problem (target customers) - everyone in cities.
4. Why is your solution better? - because it has not been implemented yet.

Hey Senior! Shadab, from the NorthCap 19csu batch this side. 
I wanted to know about the work culture and if Data Scientist posts are available at Cognizant.

Looking forward to have a short conversation.
It won't take much of your precious time.  
Thank you so much.

In this period Pie Infosystems assigned me a project named Your books.
It’s an Cross- platform accounting application which takes care of all the transactions and records that a Chartered Accountant has to take care of. 

For this training we needed to research a lot about the accounting parts. 
We researched about the invoice and government rules about GST, CST, SST and how does it apply to our daily lives.

Out training was from starting in real life projects. 
Intially, We were trained to learn and understand Dart programming language.

After some days of rigirous training we were given the task of UI/Ux design of the apps.
Then looking at my performance in the UI/UX part , I was given responsibility of designing all the webpages such as 

    a) Dashboard
    b) Quotations
    c) Invoices
    d) Payments
    e) Clients/ Vendors
    f) Expenses and purchases
    g) Company details
    h) Inventory
    i) About us ,logout

In conclusion, Pie Infosystems internship has been a very useful experience for me. I can safely say that my understanding of the job environment has increased greatly. I successfully completed all the tasks assigned to me during my internship. I have gained new knowledge and skills. I experienced that you are always learning something and that is an important factor for progress. There is a lot to explore and to improve. The two main things that I learned after my experience in this internship are the importance of time management and being self-motivated. In my internship I successfully able to learn about machine learning which is one of the most growing fields now-a-days. And this internship will also help in my academics for sure.

Internship was also a good way to find out my strengths and weaknesses. This helped me to define what skills and knowledge I must improve in the coming future. It would be better that the knowledge level of technical concepts is sufficient to contribute fully to projects. It would also be better if I can present and express myself more confidently.

At last, this internship has given me new insights and motivation also given rewards(In Form of Stipends).
