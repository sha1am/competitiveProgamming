Hive 
- open source 
- database system 
- on top of hadoop
- ETL tool. 
- it can process structered and semi-structed data


Why was Hive introduced?
- large amount of data generated
- rdbms cannot handle it 
- then we used hadoop 
- now to retrieve information , lots of lines of codes are required 
- so came hive to overcome that problem
